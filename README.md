## App Info
practicing working with hooks on a multi-layered app

- you can choose between 1000 sets of compatible colors or let the app decide for you
- choices are saved in collection
- backgrounds are generated from choices with Trianglify
- fonts change color depending on light % in background colors (not perfect since bacvkground is made out of an array of 5 colors. Working on it further.)
